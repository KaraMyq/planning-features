TorchLight: running local-monotone Enforced Hill-Climbing analysis... 

TorchLight (approximate) monotone-local-EHC analysis of sampled states:
Success and hence no local minima under h+: 100.00%
Dead-end states:   0.00%
Exit distance bound min:    0, mean:   0.00, max:    0

Time spent:    0.00 seconds instantiating 2720 easy, 0 hard action templates
               0.00 seconds reachability analysis, yielding 154 facts and 2720 actions
               0.00 seconds creating final representation with 154 relevant facts
               0.00 seconds building connectivity graph
               0.00 seconds in FD translator generating variables
               0.00 seconds preparing support graph and DTGs
               0.00 seconds statically analyzing support graph and DTGs
               0.00 seconds in guaranteed global analysis
               0.00 seconds in guaranteed local analysis of initial state
               0.00 seconds in approximate local analysis of initial state
               0.01 seconds sampling states
               0.00 seconds in guaranteed local analysis of sample states
               0.00 seconds in approximate local analysis of sample states
TL TOTAL TIME:    0.00 seconds, of which    0.00 were spent computing relaxed plans for analysis.
